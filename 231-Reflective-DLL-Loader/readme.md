# 💾❌ Project 231: Reflective DLL Loader
**Type:** Fileless Malware
**Tech:** Memory Management / PE Parsing

Loads a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) from memory directly, without ever saving it to the hard drive. This bypasses file-based antivirus scanners. Used extensively by advanced tools like Cobalt Strike and Metasploit Meterpreter.
