# ⚛️ Project 199: Quantum Encryption
**Type:** Cryptography / Defensive  
**Tech:** Lattice-based Cryptography (LWE)

## Description
A simulation of **Post-Quantum Cryptography**.
Standard encryption (RSA/ECC) relies on factoring large numbers, which Quantum Computers can solve easily (Shor's Algorithm). This project demonstrates **Lattice-Based Encryption (LWE)**, which involves adding "Noise" (Errors) to equations, making them unsolvable even for Quantum machines.
