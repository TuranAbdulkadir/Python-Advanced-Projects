# 🐉 Project 240: THE ETERNAL WORM
**Type:** Self-Propagating Malware
**Tech:** SMB Exploitation / Threading

**Risk Level:** GLOBAL CATASTROPHE
The ultimate weapon. It combines:
1.  **Scanner:** Finds vulnerable hosts automatically.
2.  **Exploit:** Uses a zero-day (simulated EternalBlue) to gain access without credentials.
3.  **Replicator:** Copies itself to the new host.
4.  **Payload:** Executes Ransomware or Wipers.
**Impact:** Can shut down global logistics, hospitals, and governments in hours (e.g., WannaCry, NotPetya).
