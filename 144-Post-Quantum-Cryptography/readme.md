# ⚛️ Post-Quantum Cryptography (LWE)

## Overview
A mathematical demonstration of **Learning With Errors (LWE)**, the foundation of NIST-approved Post-Quantum Cryptography standards (like Kyber).

## Why?
RSA and Elliptic Curve cryptography will be broken by Quantum Computers using Shor's Algorithm. Lattice-based math like this project is considered "Quantum-Safe".

## Run Status
✅ **SAFE:** Mathematical simulation.
