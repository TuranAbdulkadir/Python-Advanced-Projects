# 🤖 Project 239: Botnet Herder P2P
**Type:** Infrastructure / DDoS
**Tech:** Peer-to-Peer Networking

**Risk Level:** UNSTOPPABLE
A **Decentralized Botnet**. Unlike traditional botnets that connect to a single C2 server (which can be seized by police), this uses a P2P architecture. Every infected machine acts as both a client and a server. Commands propagate virally through the network like a rumor. Taking down the network is nearly impossible.
