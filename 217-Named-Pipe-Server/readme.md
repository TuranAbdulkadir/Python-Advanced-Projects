# 🚇 Project 217: Named Pipe C2
**Tech:** Windows Pipes
**Realism:** 100%

Implements Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using **Named Pipes**. Unlike TCP/UDP sockets, Named Pipe traffic (SMB) stays local or within the internal network and is often ignored by host-based firewalls. Used by malware like Cobalt Strike for SMB Beaconing.
