# 🐳 Project 197: Docker Escape Tool
**Type:** Cloud / Container Hacking  
**Tech:** Linux Kernel, Cgroups

## Description
Checks if the current environment is a Docker container and scans for "Container Escape" vulnerabilities.
Specifically checks for **Privileged Mode**, which grants the container nearly direct access to the Host Kernel, allowing attackers to break out of isolation.
