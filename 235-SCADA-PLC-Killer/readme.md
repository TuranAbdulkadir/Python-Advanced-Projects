# 🏭 Project 235: SCADA PLC Killer
**Type:** Industrial Cyber Warfare (ICS/OT)
**Tech:** Modbus TCP Protocol

**Risk Level:** EXTREME (Physical Damage)
Demonstrates an attack on **Operational Technology (OT)**. Unlike IT attacks that steal data, this targets **Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)** used in factories and power plants. By manipulating registers (like pressure or RPM) via the Modbus protocol, it can cause machinery to overheat, break, or explode.
