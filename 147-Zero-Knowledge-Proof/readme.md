# 🎭 Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)

## Overview
Demonstrates the cryptographic protocol where one party (Prover) can prove to another (Verifier) that they know a value `x`, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value `x`.

## Significance
Used in privacy coins (Zcash, Monero) and secure authentication systems where passwords are never sent over the network.

## Run Status
✅ **SAFE:** Math simulation.
