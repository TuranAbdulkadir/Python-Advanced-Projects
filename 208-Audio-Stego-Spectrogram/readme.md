# 🎼 Project 208: Audio Spectrogram Stego
**Type:** Crypto / Steganography
**Tech:** Signal Processing (Scipy)

## Description
Converts an image into an audio file. The image is not hidden in the file bits, but in the **Frequency Domain**.
When analyzing the generated `.wav` file using a Spectrogram viewer (like Audacity or Sonic Visualizer), the visual image reappears in the sound waves.
