# 🐢 Slowloris DoS Attack

## Description
A Denial of Service tool that uses low bandwidth. It opens many connections to the target web server and keeps them open as long as possible (by sending partial HTTP headers), exhausting the server's maximum concurrent connection pool.

## Warning
Illegal to use on websites you do not own. Use only on local test servers.
