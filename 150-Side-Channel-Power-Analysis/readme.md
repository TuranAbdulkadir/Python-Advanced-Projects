# ⚡ Side Channel Attack (Power Analysis)

## Overview
Demonstrates a **Simple Power Analysis (SPA)** attack. It recovers a secret cryptographic key by observing the execution time (which correlates to power consumption) of the device performing the encryption.

## Significance
This is why military-grade chips have "constant-time" algorithms to prevent physics-based hacking.

## Run Status
✅ **SAFE:** Simulation using sleep timers.
