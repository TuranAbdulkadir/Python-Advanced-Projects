# 🧠 Adversarial AI Attack

## Overview
Demonstrates **Adversarial Machine Learning**. It generates a "perturbation" (noise) layer that, when added to an image, forces a Neural Network to misclassify the object while looking identical to human eyes.

## Significance
As AI runs autonomous cars and security cameras, tricking these systems is the frontier of cybersecurity.

## Run Status
✅ **SAFE:** Mathematical simulation using NumPy.
